Essentially it maps resources "a name like www.google.com" to other resources "the IP address 172.211.31.12".  Many of the records exist to facilitate the
"distributed" nature of the system.

"Resolver" (aka client) will query the "DNS Server" about how to get addresses for a "DNS Namespace". 

A 
-> Route names to IP addresses (xyz.com -> 195.162.32.42)
AAAA 
-> Same as A for IPv6
CNAME / ALIAS / CANONICAL NAME
-> Maps names to names "www." -> Web1.
MX RECORD
-> Identifies (smtp) mail server for domain
SRV
-> Locate specific services...contains data about the service: service, target, port and priority (sometimes created automatically by apps)
SOA: "Start of Authority"
-> "Primary name server".. has the most up-to-date info.. one per zone
NS: Name Server
-> Authority DNS server for that name.. does not cache.  NS records can be used to identify server with up-to-date DNS info
PTR: Pointer IP -> Name
-> Basically "reverse map" for A Records
