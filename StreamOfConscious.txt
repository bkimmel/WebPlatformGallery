fieldset elements have a min-width assigned to them by default

For css sizing: min-content makes the element as skinny as possible wrapping as much as possible. Max-content makes it as wide as possible with no wrapping.

In svg transforms in series all the transforms are processed on the coordinate system before the subject is painted, which is why translate(x y) rotate(a) translate(-x, -y) rotates around x y

SVG font-size: in the style value, use px specifically... or use the presentation attribute. Otherwise Firefox doesn't interpret the font-size in user space

for SVG gradients and Patterns: A 1px length equals 1 user unit equals 100% of the width or height of the element's bounding box under an ObjectBoundingBox corrdinate system.

The time value passed to requestanimationframe is the same for each animationanimation to facilitate coordination

content: in css can take URLs for images

Gradients can xlink:href toto other gradients to use their stops.

Svg gradients get their own coordinate systems. Â Userspaceonuse uses the one for the host svg, objectboundingbox uses the ciordinate system of the bounding box with ththe top lefleft corner as the origin for transforms: coordinates are "stretched" to match the containing rectangle.

hyphens:auto along with text-align: justify (when it works on platform) does body-text jutification.

performance.getEntriesByType("paint") -> paint timing in Chrome, shows 'first-paint' & 'first-contentful-paint'

"Start every project by making the body text look good, then worry about the rest...15-25px size...120-145% line-height...45-90 chars/line"

Emsp, ensp and special spacing characterscharacters can be used to set text morr precisely.

CSS font-display: can control the timing of font-face renders (auto, block, swap, fallback, optional)

String.raw`\` returns the \ instead of treating it as an escape character

For Arrow functions, this is still evaluated at runtime so e.g. an arrow function called *inside* an object method o.method will get o as "this"

The "return" method of iterators is called on abrupt termination (break, throw, etc.) And allows thr iterator to close and clean up

Isolate your team from "bad day" effects in interviews

Zindex stacking context can be set by a number of properties and stacking contexts create a "heirarchy"

Firefox doesn't do .innerText

utf-8 can't be used in css properties (i.e. line-height: 1; ~= line-height: \000031;) even though spec suggests it kind of should be (? https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#characters )

will-change: don't put it on too many things

contain: layout=stop checking for dirties at container, size=contents do not effect size of container, paint=stuff stays in container, style=stuff inside doesn't effect container

.on('change', (e)=>{ $(e.target).val()//new value });

tspan elements don't create their own bounding box, they use the box from their containing <text> element instead

What does "chunk boundary friendly" mean?
  It means that a replace should happen even if the string to be replaced is between streaming chunks of data. For example, say I     do something like this

<button> elements in forms are implicity given type="submit" unless otherwise typed.
