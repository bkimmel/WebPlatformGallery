--Inherit:
  *Take computed value on any property from parent.
--Opticals:
  --Vertical Centering:
    *Things appear to be centered vertically when they are just slightly above the midpoint.
  --Padding:
    *To appear even, more padding should be added to the sides.
--Borders:
  *For semi-transparent borders  over a background use background-clip: padding-box; (see play.csssecrets.io/translucent-borders ) 
    Otherwise the background: white; extends under the border and "cancels" it out.  background-clip stops it at the padding.
  *Use box-shadow for multiple borders.
  *Use outline-offset to control how far out/in-side the box the outline appears (negative values for inside.)  
--Backgrounds:
  *By default, background-position refers to the padding box, so
	that borders don’t end up obscuring background images. Therefore, top
	left is by default the top left outer corner of the padding box. However,
	in Backgrounds & Borders Level 3 (http://w3.org/TR/css3‐
	background), we got a new property that we can use to change this behavior:
	background-origin. By default, its value is (quite predictably)
	padding-box. If we change it to content-box, the side and corner
	keywords we use in background-position will refer to the edge of
	the content box. Effectively, this means that any background images will
	be offset from the sides/corners as much as our padding is.
