<!-- Now: -->
<img src="cat.jpg" srcset="cat.jpg, cat-2X.jpg 2x, cat-3x.jpg 3x, cat-16x.jpg 16x">
<!-- The value before the X is the density descriptor ... i.e. if the browser displays at 2X density (Retina), it will pick cat-2X.jpg instead of cat.jpg -->

<!-- Near Future: -->
<!-- Width descriptors: Browser pick the image that best fits the width... -->
<!--  After each URL we include a “width descriptor,” which specifies each image’s pixel width. 
Is your image 1024 x 768? Stick a 1024w after its URL in srcset. 
srcset-aware browsers use these pixel widths and everything else that they know about the current 
browsing environment to pick a source to load out of the set. -->
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="cat" 
  srcset="cat-160.jpg 160w, cat-320.jpg 320w, cat-640.jpg 640w, cat-1280.jpg 1280w">
  <!-- Problem: It has to do this before it has downloaded CSS (which is the only way it could know which width it needs...)  This only works well for images that are roughly the width of the viewport... -->
 
<!-- Solution: sizes allows you to apply media rules (like media queries) to the image and direct the browser to which one it should take ... not currently supported in Safari-->
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="cat"
  srcset="cat-160.jpg 160w, cat-320.jpg 320w, cat-640.jpg 640w, cat-1280.jpg 1280w"
  sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 900px) 33vw, 254px">
<!-- Order of operations: Browser starts by going through the sizes list and matching the viewport state to the media rules ... if it's less than 480px the browser can know it will be 100vw - or 100% the width of the viewport... say it's viewport is 320px:
it will pick cat-320 because it's the image that best fits the size.
 -->  
<!-- When going through the sizes, the browser works like so:  "Is the screen size under 480px iw width?  Then the image will be 100vw wide...
If not, and it's under 900px then it's 33vw wide.  Otherwise it's 254px wide." -->
 
 
 <!-- 
 There will be times when we want to adapt our images in ways that go beyond scaling. 
 When we do, we need to snatch some of that source-picking control right back. 
 
 Enter picture.
 -->
 <!--
 A picture element contains any number of source elements and one img.
 The browser goes over the picture’s sources until it finds one whose media attribute matches the current environment.
 It sends that matching source’s srcset to the img, which is still the element that we “see” on the page.
 -->
 <picture>
	<source media="(orientation: landscape)" srcset="landscape.jpg" />
	<img src="portrait.jpg" alt="A rad wolf." />
</picture>

<!-- A more complex example with art direction: -->
<picture>
	<!-- 16:9 crop -->
	<source
		media="(min-width: 36em)"
		srcset="quilt_2/detail/large.jpg  1920w,
		        quilt_2/detail/medium.jpg  960w,
		        quilt_2/detail/small.jpg   480w" />
	<!-- square crop -->
	<source
		srcset="quilt_2/square/large.jpg  822w,
		        quilt_2/square/medium.jpg 640w,
		        quilt_2/square/small.jpg  320w" />
	<img
		src="quilt_2/detail/medium.jpg"
		alt="Detail of the above quilt, highlighting the embroidery and exotic stitchwork." />
</picture>
