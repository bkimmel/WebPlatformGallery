Talking about filters in CSS and SVG can be a bit confusing: SVG filters are defined in an SVG filter element and are usually applied within an SVG document.
CSS filters can be applied to any HTML element via the filter property. 
CSS filters such as blur, contrast and hue-rotate are shortcuts for predefined, frequently used SVG filter effects. 
Beyond that, the specification allows us to reference user-defined filters from within an SVG. 
A further point of confusion is the proprietary -ms- filter tag, which was deprecated in Internet Explorer (IE) 9 and removed when IE 10 was released.
